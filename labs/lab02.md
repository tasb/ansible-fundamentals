## Goals

- Create a static YAML inventory file
- Add new groups to the inventory file
- Change IP address on inventory file
- Create group variables
- Create host variables

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Navigate to `ansible` folder inside your home folder on control node
- [ ] Finish [Lab 01](lab01.md) to ensure you have access to managed nodes

## Guide

### Step 1: Test Inventory File

First, create an `inventory` directory and copy your inventory file to it:

```bash
mkdir inventory
mv inventory.yml inventory/hosts.yml
```

Test your inventory file using the `ansible-inventory` command:

```bash
ansible-inventory -i inventory/hosts.yml --list
```

This will display your inventory in a JSON format, showing the groups, hosts, and variables.

### Step 2: Run a Simple Ansible Command

To test, run a simple Ansible command like ping:

```bash
ansible -i inventory/hosts.yml all -m ansible.builtin.ping
```

This will ping both servers in your inventory. You should see output similar to the following:

```bash
server-1 | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
server-2 | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
```

Now let's try to run a command on a specific group. Run the following command:

```bash
ansible -i inventory/hosts.yml nodes -m ansible.builtin.command -a "hostname"
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```bash
server-1 | CHANGED | rc=0 >>
```

### Step 3: Create new groups on inventory file

Edit the `hosts.yml` file and add the following content at the end of the file:

```yaml
webserver:
  hosts:
    server1:
db:
  hosts:
    server2:
```

Now let's try to run a command on the other group. Run the following command:

```bash
ansible -i inventory/hosts.yml db -m ansible.builtin.command -a "hostname"
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```bash
server-2 | CHANGED | rc=0 >>
server-2
```

Finally let's try to run on a specific host. Run the following command:

```bash
ansible -i inventory/hosts.yml server1 -m ansible.builtin.command -a "hostname"
```

### Step 4: Create Group Variables

Create one directory named `group_vars` inside `inventory` folder.

Inside the `group_vars` folder, create a file named `all.yml` and add the following content:

```yaml
ansible_user: azureuser
```

On main `hosts.yml` file, remove `ansible_user: azureuser` from both servers.

### Step 5: Test Group Variables

Test your inventory file using the `ansible-inventory` command:

```bash
ansible-inventory -i inventory/hosts.yml --list
```

Now run an ansible command to check if you still can ping the servers:

```bash
ansible -i inventory/hosts.yml all -m ansible.builtin.ping
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```plaintext
server1 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
server2 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
```

### Step 6: Create Host Variables

Create one directory named `host_vars` inside `inventory` folder.

Create a file named `server1.yml` inside `host_vars` folder and add the following content:

```yaml
ansible_ssh_private_key_file: /home/azureuser/.ssh/<private-key-server1>
```

Create a file named `server2.yml` inside `host_vars` folder and add the following content:

```yaml
ansible_ssh_private_key_file: /home/azureuser/.ssh/<private-key-server2>
```

You should delete those variables from the `hosts.yml` file.

Let's test if the host variables are working. Run the following command:

```bash
ansible -i inventory/hosts.yml all -m ansible.builtin.ping
```

### Conclusion

You've successfully created a static YAML inventory with group and host variables in Ansible.
